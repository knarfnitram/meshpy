    Args
    ----
    mesh: Mesh
        Mesh that the line will be added to.
    beam_class: Beam
        Class of beam that will be used for this line.
    material: Material
        Material for this line.
    start_point, end_point: _np.array, list
        3D-coordinates for the start and end point of the line.

    **kwargs (for all of them look into create_beam_mesh_function)
    ----
    n_el: int
        Number of equally spaced beam elements along the line. Defaults to 1.
        Mutually exclusive with l_el.
    l_el: float
        Desired length of beam elements. Mutually exclusive with n_el.
        Be aware, that this length might not be achieved, if the elements are
        warped after they are created.
    start_node: Node, GeometrySet
        Node to use as the first node for this line. Use this if the line
        is connected to other lines (angles have to be the same, otherwise
        connections should be used). If a geometry set is given, it can
        contain one, and one node only.

    Return
    ----

        Set with the 'start' and 'end' node of the line. Also a 'line' set
        with all nodes of the line.
