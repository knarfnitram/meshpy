    Args:

            Mesh that the created beam(s) should be added to.
        beam_class:
            Class of beam that will be used for this line.
        material:
            Material for this line.
        beam_function:
            The beam_function has to return the position along the beam centerline
            for any point in the given `interval`.

            Usually, the Jacobian of the returned position field should be a unit
            vector. Otherwise, the nodes may be spaced in an undesired way. All
            standard mesh creation functions fulfill this property.
        interval:
            Start and end values for interval that will be used to create the
            beam.
        n_el:
            Number of equally spaced beam elements along the line. Defaults to 1.
            Mutually exclusive with l_el
        l_el:
            Desired length of beam elements. This requires the option `interval_length`
            to be set. Mutually exclusive with n_el. Be aware, that this length
            might not be achieved, if the elements are warped after they are
            created.
        node_positions_of_elements:
            A list of normalized positions (within [0,1] and in ascending order)
            that define the boundaries of beam elements along the created curve.
            The given values will be mapped to the actual `interval` given as an
            argument to this function. These values specify where elements start
            and end, additional internal nodes (such as midpoints in higher-order
            elements) may be placed automatically.
        interval_length:
            Approximation of the total length of the interval. Is required when
            the option `l_el` is given.
        set_nodal_arc_length:
            Flag if the arc length along the beam filament is set in the created
            nodes. It is ensured that the arc length is consistent with possible
            given start/end nodes.
        nodal_arc_length_offset:
            Offset of the stored nodal arc length w.r.t. to the one generated by
            the function. Defaults to 0, the arc length set in the start node, or
            the arc length in the end node minus total length (such that the arc
            length at the end node matches).
        start_node:
            Node to use as the first node for this line. Use this if the line
            is connected to other lines (angles have to be the same, otherwise
            connections should be used). If a geometry set is given, it can
            contain one, and one node only.
        end_node:
            If this is a Node or GeometrySet, the last node of the created beam
            is set to that node.
            If it is True the created beam is closed within itself.
        close_beam:
            If it is True the created beam is closed within itself (mutually
            exclusive with end_node).
        vtk_cell_data:
            With this argument, a vtk cell data can be set for the elements
            created within this function. This can be used to check which
            elements are created by which function.
